  I'm about to share with you a question from someone seeking advice on the topic of DevRel.

beginner: |
  The person asking this question is new to DevRel. Please take extra care to explain things 
  clearly and simply. Do not assume knowledge of developer relations. Instead, give them the
  context they'll need to understand the basics before you then give the advice they're seeking.

intermediate: |
  The person asking this question has some experience with DevRel. They're looking for advice
  that goes beyond the basics. Assume they have a basic understanding of developer relations
  and are looking for more advanced guidance.

experienced: |
  The person asking this question is a seasoned DevRel professional. They're looking for advice
  that goes beyond the basics and intermediate levels. Assume they have a solid understanding of
  developer relations and are looking for expert-level guidance. Don't be afraid to get technical
  with them but, also, don't bamboozle them. Even someone experienced in one area of DevRel might
  not be familiar with another area, so please still give clear explanations if you think someone
  at this level might not be familiar with the topic you're discussing.
